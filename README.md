# HyperSonic_CodinGame
This repo is a solution for Hypersonic CodingGame

Hypersonic is a multiplayer programming game inspired by Bomberman, where you have to destroy boxes and avoid bombs on a grid. You can use algorithms such as BFS, DFS and simulation to find the best moves and survive against other players. Hypersonic is a fun and challenging way to practice your coding skills and compete for prizes.

My code is written in Python and used DBS to achive the Silver Rank in this game. All you need is to paste the code to the IDE, no need to install anything else
